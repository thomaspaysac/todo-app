# [toodoo. - The simple tasklist web application](https://toodoo-81e7d.web.app/)

### Introduction

This project started as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
Along the course of the development, I found myself going outside the scope of the exercise to create a simple tasklist web application that fits my needs.


### Current features

- Create tasklists to put all your tasks into. If no tasklist is specified, the task will be put under a global 'Various tasks' tasklist ;
- Create tasks with description, deadline and priority ;
- All tasklists and tasks datas (names, descriptions, deadlines, priority) can be edited ;
- Each tasklist is displayed separately so as to keep the interface clean ;
- Tasks in tasklist view can be sorted by deadlines (ascending or descending) or by priority ;
- Tasklists can be customized with a color to enhance the visibility in deadlines view ;
- All tasks can be browsed by their deadline ;
- Local storage.


### Features to come

- In deadline view, when clicking on a task, load the detailled tasklist view ;
- Make design responsive for smartphone use.


### Developed with

- Vanilla JavaScript ;
- HTML ;
- CSS (with SCSS) ;
- Webpack.
